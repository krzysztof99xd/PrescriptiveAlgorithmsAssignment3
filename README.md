I had some questions regarding the optimazation part, I went to Q&A session. Please find them below:

I was struggling with understanding some concepts:

Q:What is an individual? -> A: This could be one possible solution. In the assignment it is written what are the requeirements for the solution engine maintenance, start date, end date, what team has been allocated to that engine 
Q:What is the whole population? -> A: This could be a set of possible solutions

Q: Do we want to allocate teams to ALL the engines or only to engines that have a predicted safety due date of less than 30? -> A: We need to deal with only engines that have RUL < T time horizon (that is 30 days in the assignment)

Q:Any tips on the termination criteria? Maybe after all machines have planned maintanance more than 30? -> A:There is not necessarily one in this case but bear in mind that there are instructions for how long you are supposed to run the experiments

Q: What is the fitness value in our case: -> A: That is the value of penalty cost! The lower the penalty cost, the better (so better the fitness value)

Q: How many parents do we select ins the process? It is not clear to me and I can not deduct from the slides. -> A: It depends on you, you have different methods presented to you on the slides, you decide on that. 

More questions? We could text the TA
